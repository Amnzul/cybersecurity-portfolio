<P>I earned my Comptia Network+ Certification in February 2025.</P>

<P>I studied for the Comptia Network+ Certification by watching Professor Messer’s videos on Youtube, and googling the Comptia Exam Objectives I needed more help understanding.</P>

<P>I earned my Google Cybersecurity Certificate in May 2025.</P>

<P>I learned about cybersecurity through Google’s Cybersecurity Program on Coursera. I did all the exercises and found it paired well with my networking experience so far.</P>

<P>I’ve always had a high interest in computers. When I have spare time I enjoy working on computer related projects with my home lab.</P>
