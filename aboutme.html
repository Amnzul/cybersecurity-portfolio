I earned my Comptia Network+ Certification in February 2025.

I studied for the Comptia Network+ Certification by watching Professor Messer’s videos on Youtube, and googling the Comptia Exam Objectives I needed more help understanding.

I earned my Google Cybersecurity Certificate in May 2025.

I learned about cybersecurity through Google’s Cybersecurity Program on Coursera. I did all the exercises and found it paired well with my networking experience so far.

I’ve always had a high interest in computers. When I have spare time I enjoy working on computer related projects with my home lab.
