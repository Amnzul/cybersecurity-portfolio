<h2> Raspberry Pi Project Overview</h2>


<div>
<p>My first raspberry pi was a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w I bought in August 2024.</p>
<p>At first, I connected a usb keyboard and mouse to it, the hdmi cable from my tv, and connected to my home wireless. I was surprised to find a full computer with a gui operating system on such a tiny device. It’s only sipping a few watts which is amazing!</p>
<p>I installed pi hole on it and set my smart tv’s dns to the pi hole.</p>
<p>I run ad blocking plugins on my pc’s browser and am used to no ads on youtube or prime video. I had hoped the pi hole would elevate the smart tv to the same experience. Ads still show in YouTube and prime tv. Apparently they are served from the same servers as the content so it’s hard to separate them this way.</p>
<p>The pi hole statistics show about 30% of all requests coming from the tv are blocked though. Much of this is Netflix telemetry (even when not watching Netflix) and LG’s built-in advertising.</p>

<p>I keep it set up because even though it’s not blocking all the ads, it’s at least getting a lot of invasive stuff. I enabled ssh and disconnected everything except the power and wifi from it. So now it’s as unobtrusive as possible, but still accessible on my local network.</p>
<p>The raspberry pi was such a clever device I bought a second one, this time with built in headers for more projects.</p>
 
<p>That’s it!</p>
