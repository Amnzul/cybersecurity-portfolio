<h2>Orb Network Monitoring Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project involved installing an Orb Sensor on an Alpine Container in Proxmox to monitor network and internet performance.</p>

  
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Orb is a free network monitoring utility for rating internet responsiveness, reliability, and speed available at <a href="https://orb.net/">https://orb.net/</a></p>
<p>Orb works with a dashboard and a sensor. I will run the app on my mobile phone, and the sensor on an Alpine Linux container in a Proxmox server. Many options are available for where it can be run.</p>
  
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<P>I used a helper script to quickly install an Alpine Linux container in Proxmox. The script is available at this repository for <a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=alpine&category=Operating+Systems">Proxmox VE Helper Scripts on github.</a></P>

<p>Run the script provided in the Proxmox shell.</p>

<h2>Orb Sensor Setup</h2>

<h2>Performance Findings &amp; Analysis</h2>
<P></P>

<P>The ratings are all in the green. However, I have a fiber optic connection. I was expecting to see better upload/download numbers. I ran a speedtest through my local ISP's webpage and obtained different results. I suspect the difference is because the test from Orb is relying on a server on a different network for their results.</P>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<P>It could be helpful to have instantaneous insight into network performance if I am experiencing latency somethere. </P>
<p>This can serve as a method to document baseline performance metrics for future comparative analysis.</p>
<P>I will keep the Orb sensor running and get some more data to see what it looks like over time.</P>
  
<p>That’s it!</p>
