<p>I was taught to crimp cable somewhere along the way. But it was a long time ago and I don’t own the tools myself. For the limited amounts of cable I need in my home network, it’s more practical to buy it commercially.</p>
<p>Here I will review a few noteworthy terms and pieces of advice about network cables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat6 allows 10 Gbps (Gigabits per second) up to 55 meters</li>
<li>Cat6a allows 10 Gbps (Gigabits per second) up to 100 meters</li>
</ul>

<p>Cat6a cable is heavier than cat6 and less flexible.</p>
<p>Sellers on Amazon are prone to fraud, at this time in 2024. Commscope and Belden are two big name commercial companies that supply trustworthy cables.</p>
<p>Go for solid copper and always avoid cheaper copper clad aluminum. Braided is ok for flexible short cables.</p>
<p>American wire gauge (AWG) 23 is the standard for cat6a cable. Avoid the thinner awg 30 stuff as it won’t be as reliable over distance or allow Power over Ethernet.</p>
<p>Bonded ensures the twisted pair maintain the correct length of twists. Avoid flat wires.</p>
<p>Plenum cabling is low smoke and doesn’t emit chemicals in case of a fire. It’s required in many commercial situations, but not necessary for home.</p>
<p>Shielded twisted pair has individual pairs wrapped in foil to cut down on crosstalk and has less noise than unshielded. Shielded requires a grounded cable. This may only be necessary in environments with lots of cables run together.</p>
<p>⁃ The PC I built in 2023 has a ASRock PRO Z790 PRO RS WiFi motherboard, whose ethernet port is 2.5Gb.<br>⁃ The PC I built in 2016 has a MSI Z170A GAMING M5 LGA 1151 ATX Intel Motherboard, whose ethernet port is only 1Gb.</p>
<p>I have four 2.5Gb ports on my Asus Router. The rest are only rated for 1Gb.</p>
<p>Given all this information, the cable isn’t a bottleneck for my own home network.</p>


<p>Thats all for now!</p>
