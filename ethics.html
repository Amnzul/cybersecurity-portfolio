<h2>Ethics</h2>

<P>In my cybersecurity coursework, we reviewed the CIA triad framework – Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. As we broke down each component, I found myself nodding in agreement, realizing this framework perfectly aligns with my own code of ethics.</P>

<P>I’ve always held a high level of respect for privacy and believe we have a responsibility to safeguard private assets and data. Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use. As security professionals, we carry an ethical obligation to secure private information. No one should have their private data, whether it’s personal communication, healthcare information, or financial accounts leaked in a breach.</P>

<P>The exception is elected officials, they should be required to disclose that information to voters. But it’s not leaked or stolen. Public service workers need to be transparent and just.</P>

<P>I’m nervous about the implications of quantum computing and what it means for security and cryptography.</P>

<P>Your data must be reliable. The first time I experienced a hard drive failure and lost journals and precious family photos I was crushed. I am now a firm advocate of backups.</P>

<P>The CIA triad put into words feelings I’ve always had about data and digital responsibility. This struck true with me in a way I wasn’t expecting. The world would be a better place if everyone respected these values, not just in cybersecurity, but in how we treat each other’s information and privacy in general.</P>

<P>It’s reassuring to know that what I’m studying isn’t just technical concepts, but principles that reflect the kind of person I want to be.</P>
